                "HA... HA... HA" you think to yourself for the first time in forever. <br>
                GUN EMOJI EXPLOSION EMOJI GRAVE EMOJI<br>
                Each option may be different <br>
                THE TRUTH? THE TRUTH IS SIMPLE DEAR FRIEND, YOU ARE BEYOND SALVATION.<br>
                I never texted to meet in the alley. I talked to you in person.<br>
                BUT ALAS HE DOES NOT SEE THE PIT OF WHICH HE'LL TRIP INTO.<br>
                why are you stuck with yourself? This is just stupid. Why did you even bother? Now you're just there dead already.<br>
                But they begin to blurr and mix <br>
                The pavement will always be covered in tears.<br>
                You managed to roll out of bed without breaking your neck but now you've just slipped on tear stained pavement and cracked your skull<br>
                The paths where you meet yourself <br>
                YOU JUMP IN AND CUT HER THROAT. NO THAT WASN'T IT. WAS IT DECAPITATION? NO NO NO. IT INVOLVED A KNIFE. AH. NOW YOU REMEMBER.<br>
                BUT ALAS! you get ran over by a car on the way there. By the time they get you to the hospital all the doctors turn you away saying that "he's a dead man".<br>
                Are the key to escape <br>
                You try to make out with him but he uses The ThRUSTER on you! <br>
