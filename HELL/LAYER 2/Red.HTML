            <p>
                That's odd... There is no note there anymore. You rummage in your drawers and see an empty paper and pen with your phone. <br>
                <span class="madness">"Odd"</span> You mutter to yourself. You get yourself dressed up anyways and go outside. It never really occured to you but sometimes it feels like you're not seeing people. Like, who remembers what the person you just passed by on the sidewalk looks like?
                However that's not important to you, today is a great day! We're going out to date! and WE are the red flags! HAHAHAHAH! <br>
                We sing in tantalizing rhymes <span class="madness">"Lake side tragedy. Tell thee where she hangs by the tree! To stab and weep is akin to sleep!" </span> <br>
                Now where would YOU find a flag just as red as you?
