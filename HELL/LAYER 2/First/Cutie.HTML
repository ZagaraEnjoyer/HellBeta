            <h1>Speechless for days</h1>
            <p>
                You're gobsmacked- No, that's not enough to describe your vocal chords at the moment. It's like someone whacked a metal pipe straight into your diaphram,
                and then while reeling in pain you fall down 10 km into a bed where you then meet the sexiest lady in the wild wild [insert your ethnicity likings here]. 
                That's what you're feeling as you step onto the bus. She follows suit and both of you sit on the same row of the bus. The old rudementary lighting of this vehichle is pretty non romantic but that's of no concern.
                For she starts the conversation.<br><br>

                <span class="forn">"Hey," Oh dear, She sounds even better than she looks.</span> <br> <br>
                Oh you feel your legs just melting. Thank god you're sitting down. With the pathetic voice of a nervous nerd you say, "Hi, my name is Vasanistírio..." Oh god you're pathetic. And you were here to go for a date?! <br><br>

                <span class="forn">"You're not gonna ask me my name huh?" she says in a oddly teasing tone. It feels affectionate to you, "My name is fórn"</span> 
                <br><br>
                "Hi fórn, my name's Vasanistírio" You mindlessly repeat because you're too starstruck to even comprehend basic communication. <br> <br>
                She laughs though. <span class="forn">"Oh you're funny"</span> if compliments were a light punch then you would be decapitated right now, <span class="forn">"How about we meet later? You seem like someone who listens instead of talk"</span> <br> <br>
                Alright now you're utterly speechless. Is being defensless a good way to flirt with people? All you can muster is a slight nod. She giggles like a child and writes her phone number on a spare piece of paper. She then slides it into your pocket as she exits the bus at her stop.

                Now you're just sitting there, pretty sure you missed your stop like... 5 minutes ago.
                You get out of the bus aswell and now you're at a crosswords/crossroads.
