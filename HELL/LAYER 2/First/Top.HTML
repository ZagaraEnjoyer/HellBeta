                While you do feel like someone hit you with a lead pipe, you muster up the courage to talk first. <br>

                "hey," Hey? really? You could have chosen litterally anything else to meet her but you say hey?! <br><br>

                <span class="forn">"heya, what's your name?"</span> she says with confidence that almost knocks you over and down for the count. Her sheer gravtias, the irrisistablity palpably enthusiastic forms of confidance! <br><br>
                "uhm. Vasanistírio, you?" AN UHM?!iu!jnfiuk!@##!(!)???? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND!~!!>!?! YOU'RE FUMBLING SO HARD. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU. <br><br>
                by some miracle she finds your response cute, <br><br>
                 <span class="forn">"fórn's my name"</span>
                 <br><br> 
                 "So... how are you doing?" You try to make a pathetic attempt at conversation.
                 <span class="forn">"I'm doing just fine. What's up with that business suit? Are you a salesman?"</span> <br>
                 "Yeah, for a matress store. Why are you so good looking though?" Finally, something kind of smooth but a bit over the top.<br>
                 She chuckles for a bit, <span class="forn">"I just look this way by default."</span> <br>
                 "Do you want to hang out sometime later today?" you ask, a bead of sweat  trickling its way on your forehead. <br>
                 <span class="forn">"I'd love to, how about the park by 3:20?"</span>
