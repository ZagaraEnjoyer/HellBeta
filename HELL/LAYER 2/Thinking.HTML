                You point at yourself with a slight smirk. "Tiss thee, Vasanist√≠rio! And he is in danger"
                The guards look at you like you are a 'special' kind of guy.  Their snide look of judgement. It's very much infuriating.
                Who are THEY to judge who YOU are, huh? What if they are the real monsters! They probably nevver even existed! but no. This isn't right. There was never supposed to be a prison here!
                It was something lame. Like a police station or something.

                "And why would that be the case?" They say ever so skeptically. Their apperation for body like features. It's so taunting. It almost makes you wanna do...
