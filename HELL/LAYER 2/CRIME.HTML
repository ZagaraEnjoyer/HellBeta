                You go out into the street. The air fills with CRIME! It's a rather fantastical way to spend the night eh? you walk to a busstop,
                the metal caging of the infernal construct reeks of vandalism. You got so caught up tallying all the illegal counts of innapropriate sprays you hadn't noticed
                a woman on the other side of this busstop. She's wearing a buisness suit. Her valuable emerald eyes just begging to be stolen.
                But they just end up stealing all your attention. Before you could muster up the courage to kidnap her into your house she's already gone into the bus that arrived 10 seconds ago.
                You just stand there like a moron.
