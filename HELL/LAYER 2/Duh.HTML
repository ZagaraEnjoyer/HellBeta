                Ah right! Let's not get carried away in our thoughts eh? Now then it's just what... <br>
                hmmmmm. Lets check your phone eh? <br>
                *rummaging. making a couple loud noises as you cut your hand on a photo. Sliding aside a unworn wedding ring box... <br>
                Bingo! You grab your pathetic phone, still connected to a wire with the rubber all frictioned off from old fashioned wear & tear. You unplug your phone. Who to contact?

                    You have no idea how many times he dies! One path after the other! He misses the past because of what it had to him. A simple fate, the end of the story. But this? He can't accept this! Let the sin die in the grave it buried please.
                    Stop pumping the dirt, concrete, guilt ridden blood back into the coffin. Vasanistírio begs of it.
