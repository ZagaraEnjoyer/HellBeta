                Why of course! Let's take a vacation from our job and leave the firearms behind! You unlock the door and turn the knob before you kick it open with your good foot.
                Ahh the sunshine sure is bright. But it is no match for your all black fit. mmhmm~. The fresh air, the crispy cut grass. It's enough to make anyone enjoy their life.
                You take a walk to a bus-stop.<br>
                <br>
                But to your unfortunate dismay, the fabulous member of the fairer sex is not here. While you two havent really talked much, it was nice company while waiting for the bus. Sometimes you two would meetup someplace to talk and admire those... ah! <br>
                The bus arrives! The smell of wretched deathly smog follows swiftly behind this rather derelict vehichle, 666 is the number of the bus. Checks out.
                You step inside to see it's only you and the driver in here. He reeks of cigarrette smoke. <br>
                Now then where to visit for this fine day?
