                You feel like a failure for not kidnapping her. You step into a bank, your cane in hand. The concepts of guns felt unessiscary to you.
                Guns are meant to kill, how the hell is anyone supposed to do anything when people are dead? It's so much easier to get people to do what you want when you do it with your cane.
                The black staff of make a wish is what some folks call it but you personally call it "The Thruster" because thats what you use it for when people don't listen. You're pretty sure the make a wish part is reffering to how most people beg for death like it's their final wish.
                You decide to pull a fast one with a simple but fun trick. You used to do this in highschool based entirely on a dare for 20 bucks. But this dare will pay you in thousands if you do it right.
                Now lets see which dare it will be today.
