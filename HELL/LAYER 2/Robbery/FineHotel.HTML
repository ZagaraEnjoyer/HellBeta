            <h1 class="">You feel a bit nervous</h1>
            <p>
                It feels weird. Very weird. Considering what you said to your employer yesterday it just feels wrong pretending like nothing happened. <br><br>
                But at the same time, you want to cherish this moment just a little while longer. You think her name is <span class="forn">Forn</span> with a tilde over the o.
                It really dazzled you multiple times. Just seeing her green eyes.
                You straighten up your <span class="fancy">black tie</span>, deep breaths then you step inside.
                The area is quite dazzling, a nice crystal chandilier glistening a nice orange spectacle of light across the area leaving shadowy spots in the floors and walls.
                There you see her, the one and only woman that could persist in your memories even after death. <span class="forn">Forn</span>...
                You straighten your <span class="fancy">hat and hankercheif</span> as an inante response to being nervous as you aproach her in her emerald dress beauty.
                <span class="fancy">"Morning"</span> you say with a hint of delight at her sight. <br><br>
                <span class="forn">"Hello~! I'm glad you're here. I know it's a bit like rushing things to book a hotel room together but I think it's good for first impressions. Don't you think so?"</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="fancy">"Oh, absolutely! Lest why even have such marvelous clothes collecting dust in the wardrobe?"</span> You say with a smile half made wryly and half made in joy. <br><br>
                The two of you spend a moment just looking into eachother's eyes in akward silence. Small little wrinkles just under her eye, mascara emphasizing her wonderful eyes. Lips with such detail that you have never noticed before. She then pulls you past reception and to the elevator.
                <br><br> Her tone becomes a bit more serious as she presses a button <span class="forn">"So what do you want for dinner?"</span> <br>
            </p>
