                You get onto the bus. Lone and derelict. It's like a pretty little tale. You sit down just behind the busdriver. Leaning your head at an awkward angle just to see him in his reaview mirror.
                A peculiar looking woman with sweet emeral eyes. You feel... <br>
                It's not butterflies... <br>
                hmmm...<br>
                ...<br>
                <span class="surprise">AGHK!</span><br>
                The bus comes tumbling through streets.
                Countless. Countless yous?
                Some seem awestruck with a lady at the bus stop.
                Some are still in bed by the window calling someone.
                But... But every second version as the bus passes by, are dead?
                You ask the lady: <br>
                "Madam, what the hell is going on?" <br>
                she looks at you with the same stare of the prophet and says <br>
                "Finding the truth you silly <span class="silence angy">KILLER</span> <span class="silence">cutie pie</span> <span class="silence">lovable criminal</span>" <br>
                You're both confused and totally releived.
                But before you could have asked another question, the bus arrives to your destination. A small rundown matress store. A front for where you work. <br>
                You wave goodbye to the strange busdriver as they leave. Never to be seen again by you...... <br>
                ............ <br>
                ............ <br>
                You now know what you felt. <br>
                It's regret.
