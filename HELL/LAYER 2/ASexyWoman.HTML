                You go out into the street. The air fills with Romance! You take careful steps on the sidewalk to not step on the cracks. Why?
                You don't know. After a while of walking, you get to a bus stop. You stand there and wait for a bus.
                <br>...
                <br>...
                <br>...
                <br>...
                <br>...
                <br>...
                Quite a long time has been passing. It's night time now, the streetlights dimly illuminate your body. Now you see a figure in the distance.
                a feminine shilouette in a pretty buisness suit. Both of you lock eyes for a moment. Her pretty emerald eyes. You feel starstruck.
                She stands on the other side of the bus stop.
