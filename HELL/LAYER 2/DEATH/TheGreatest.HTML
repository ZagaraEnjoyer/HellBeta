                You get the knife <br>
                Then you get the salts <br> <br>
                A Circle around Cheese & Pedestal <br>
                You Lay down with candles <br> <br>
                This is for her. Emerald eyes... With a swift vigor you strike: <br>
                "All my love and empathy to yo-" <br><br>
                You died of heart stabbing for two reasons:<br>
                1. You're a prick<br>
                2. You know this isn't what you did<br>
                3. If you did then welcome to purgatory <br><br>
                The last one is what your sorry rear would hear from him.
                But I intervened,<br>
