                We run to the bank! Why don't we burn money like that funny clown featuring a furry cosplaying as a bat? or was it the bat that was cosplaying the human? <br>
                No time to delve into such <span class="madness">LAAAAAAAAAMEEEEEE</span> topics! We're on a mission and that mission is to drop kick the guard at the front and using the momentum of the drop kick into the other guard.
                BUT BEFORE YOU COULD SET THE PLACE ALIGHT, SOMEONE ALREADY PULLED THE FIRE ALARM! In a rage you go straight after the (very sexy tall dark and handsome man) who pulled the fire alarm! <br>
                You try to make out with him but he uses The ThRUSTER on you! breaking your internal organs as you bleed out internally. As a last ditch effort to say "you're cute" you set the entrances alight and tackle him. <br>
                He thrusts the Thruster into your head
