                I went to the phone and call her. But my heart is so weak and heavy from the first encounter.
                Simply hearing her <span class="forn">"hello?"</span> is enough to make me drop dead.
                and I would do it again.
                Dropping every single time. <br>
                Dropping into the ground.<br>
                Dropping at her voice.<br>
                But no matter how many times I can do this. <br>
                The pavement will always be covered in tears.<br><br><br>
