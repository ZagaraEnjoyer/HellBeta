                AHAHAHAHAHAHA.
                you look at the mirror.
                your depressed sorry look of misery exists in place of your face.
                You can't even recall what you looked like happy.
                You knew that every single option in the back there is going to kill you.
                Choices with I will just lead to death.
                And the other option doesn't seem like you'll survive. <br>
                "HA... HA... HA" you think to yourself for the first time in forever. <br>
                "You die" says your mirror <br>
                "Yes, and I will die too" you respond in kind <br>
                You recall a date... a date that will never be talked about in this hell...
