            <p class="angy">
                You managed to roll out of bed without breaking your neck but now you've just slipped on tear stained pavement and cracked your skull.
                You didn't even kiss her either you loser.
                gosh.
                why are you stuck with yourself? This is just stupid. Why did you even bother? Now you're just there dead already. You have no idea how you're still reading this despite being DEAD.
                Honestly, the reason why there is no more elaborate description of your pathetic death is because this is impatience. There isn't enough time. There never is! Gosh... Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do.
                Like this text rambling on and on and on with no end in sight. By the way, did you know that you can conciously blink? Oh did you know that you have to breath manually sometimes? You feel your clothes on your body. Your socks are on a bit too tightly. The seam in your sock is annoying your toe.
                your neck has to hold your head. Are you sitting/standing up straight? How about that sore on your body that you just refuse to aknowledge?
                Are your legs in a comfortable position? Did you drink your water? Are you hungry? Do you need to go to the bathroom? Did you swallow your spit? do you hear the background noise you just zoned yourself out of?
