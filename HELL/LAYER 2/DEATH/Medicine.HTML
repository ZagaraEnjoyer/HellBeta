                End of times indeed<br>
                Emerald eyes must bleed<br> <br>
                Ever true love<br>
                must be destroyed<br> <br>
                Like a knife to a dove<br>
                The bird must be drugged<br><br>
                He walked into a medicine store<br>
                Salt and cheese in hand<br>
                candlelight in the cake he offer<br>
                A knife to cut the hearts and the sugars<br><br>
                Drug the slice and propose <br>
                The only thing that was as it seemed<br>
                was a vulgar rose soaked in tears at the seams<br>
