            It was so simple. I knew a part of me... Longed for this. I knew it wasn't right. But I knew what I needed to do.
            There wasn't a life where I would live without you. But now something had grown. My emotions have overflown. I knew something was off.
            But now It was due. An apathy that would construe my love into a loft. Vasanist√≠rio had died. He does not know why.
            I never texted to meet in the alley. I talked to you in person. At a party of the ninth day. It was no choice. Timotheos had forced my hand like how god had forced his.
            I am.
            Sorry.
