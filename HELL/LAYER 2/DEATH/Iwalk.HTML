                I just decide to leave her. She looks at me with a noncholant glance before she goes on the bus. I walk My sorry failure of a date back home.
                Why do I bother? It's ME, Vasanist√≠rio, who's going to even care if I die? No one gives a damn about this broken heart.
                Before I could tie myself a noose I fall down to the ground from heart attack.
