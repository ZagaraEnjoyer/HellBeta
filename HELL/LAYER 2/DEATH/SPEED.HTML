                YOU JUMP IN AND CUT HER THROAT. NO THAT WASN'T IT. WAS IT DECAPITATION? NO NO NO. IT INVOLVED A KNIFE. AH. NOW YOU REMEMBER. <BR>
                    YOU MESSED IT ALL UP. <br>
                        THE GOD'S ARE UNHAPPY WITH YOU NOW. <BR>
                            A TRUE DEVOTEE THAT FAILED <BR>
                Lightning strikes you with the wrath of despair and a failed sacrifice. It burns like an unholy flame. You being a failed sinner. A man with no deiety. The man who jumps the gun that has been sabotaged.
                and now. Now you are there, twitching like an epeleptic under a seizure. dying out on the floor. You wish your heart would just kill you. But there is no salvation.
                Suffering.
                Suffering.
                Suffering.
                Then.
                Death
