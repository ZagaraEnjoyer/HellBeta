                You text your ex: <br>
                "I miss you darling <3" <br> <br>
                But then BAM! she responds with: <br>
                "I missed you too &#127825;" <br> <br>
                Oh my! how spicy. Raunchy too... With a swift vigor you type: <br>
                "Maybe I could come over to yo-" <br><br>
                You died of heart attack for two reasons:<br>
                1. You're a dirty dog<br>
                2. You used I in your message you dunce<br>
                3. Go burn in hell <br><br>
                The last one is what your ex would have said to you.
                So go ahead,<br>
