                You text her: <br>
                "Hey, Vasanist√≠rio speaking." <br><br>
                You hate yourself for describing yourself like that. It's just moronic. But for some odd reason, she types back:<br>
                "Heya! You're the guy at the bus right? You said you go there frequently but I go there everyday, so how come just now we met?"<br><br>
                Wow, You don't know whether she's just plain impressed at the odds or if she's an undercover cop.<br>
                "It's just a place that he goes to whenever he feels, something" you respond as cryptic as ever.<br><br>

                Anyways, you up to go somewhere?" she responds.<br><br>
                Something about her just seems too... too good. Yeah you're probably a psychopath, maybe she's the Liar, or as your mother puts it; 'the backstabber in the day'.<br>
                never the less, you have to respond with something
