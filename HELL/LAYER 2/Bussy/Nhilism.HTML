                You sigh. Crawling out of bed with no regard for your life. You slip and fall onto the ground. Unfortunately, You're still alive... <br>
                Groaning in pain, you get up.<br>
                *Ring ring* you hear<br>
                *ring ring ring* echoes in the room <br>
                *ring ring ring ring* <br>
                It's getting real anno- *RING RING RING*<br>
                With the hatred of Dissapointment, you pick it up<br>
                "Yeah?" You ask.<br>
                "Vasanistírio, don't forget the deal" the familiar unmistakable voice says to you<br>

                "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND" You shout into the phone before abruptly hanging up.<br>
                Sitting down you try and collect your thoughts.
                You don't want to.<br><br>
                But you <span class = "angy">HAVE</span> to...<br><br>
                Just do it... The faster you do it. The better. It's for God. The Unmerciful lord of...<br>
