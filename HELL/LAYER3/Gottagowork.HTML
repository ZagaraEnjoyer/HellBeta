                You realize that you're going to be late for work and run on your way t.here. It's a matress store that's a little run down, It's more of a front really <br>.
                You take a few steps inside to meet your co-workers, just fumbling about with no customers. They look busy by looking under the matresses repeatedly. It's very dull now that you think about it.
                You walk to your employer's door.<br><br>
                knock knock knock. pause pause. knock pause knock pause knock. pause pause. knock knock knock.<br><br>
                you get a phone message.
                "What is it?" says [][][][][][][][][] <br><br>
                "Vasanistírio found the green eyes" you say. A part of you feels like you just dug your own grave.<br><br>
                Silence<br><br>
                and more silence<br><br>
                "What about the partner?" you hear faintly behind the door, it's gruff and harsh. <br><br>
                "She doesn't have one. [][][][][][][][][], I think she likes Vasanistírio" you say hesitantly. You know what this means. You don't want to do it. <br><br>
                "That's... I can see how that is a predicament for you. Vasanistírio, I thank you for telling me this. I understand how this is hard for you. But you know what this is. I doubt it because there is no way you-" <br><br>
                "Developed feelings for her too." you interject <br><br>
                more silence. It's deafening, your coworkers may have heard it because they're just standing there. Looking at you.<br><br>
                "Then kill her." he says so... <span class="apathy" onclick="Ap()">Apathetically.</span><br><br>
                "No! Give some time please. Maybe.. Maybe it will get better!" <br><br>
                there's just more silence. You feel sick. You fill horrid. You know they're watching. Not your coworkers, they can understand. <br><br>
                "Fine, Nine days. You have Nine days. Nothing more, nothing less. Vasanistírio, you're one of my most devoted subjects towards the cause. This is me repaying you with the kindess you have given us"<br><br>
                You walk out of there with your fists clenched without saying a word. You don't know whether it will be more torture or worth it in the end if you even manage to get there.
