            <h1 class="">Finally a good joke</h1>
            <p>
                She laughs, <span class="forn">"You're funny. I'll just get you some of this Egusi soup on the menu."</span> she says with a smile. the curves are akin to that of a waning moon crescent. <br>
                You would like to say something but nothing else comes to mind. You feel like there's a hole in your stomach that's slowly eating away. It feels like <span class="dread">dread</span>... <br>
                You say something that you don't recall as you head off to the bathroom. <br>

                "You can't do this" You say to the mirror. <br>
                <span class="dread">But it will come. You can't prevent it. She will die. If not by you then by someone else</span> <br>
                "There has to be a way. There's only oh so many variations where she dies. There has to be at least one" <br>
                <span class="apathy">Even so, the vast majority will die and suffer. Even if life was to loop for eternity and our path to these events are not intrinisically locked, She WILL die</span> <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                You just hear the sounds of ventilation in the bathroom with the occacional flush of the toilets in the background. <br>
                "Well. Every moment with her is WORTH something. How about we figure out whether the vast majority of thee will be happy to just meet her once?" <br>
                <span class="apathy">You can't cling onto this theory that you'll relive your entire life every time you die. How would you even change the actions you take? You would be a machine, blindly following orders at the press of someone else's buttons.</span>
                <br>
                That's a risk worth taking though, if it isn't true then there will be plenty of time to recover while if it is true then you could be making a severe mistake.
                What if?
                What if.
                Is there a way you could have changed your path?
                Or will you just be stuck in this loop of being born. Meeting her, going to this hotel. Talking to yourself in the mirror? over and over again with no recolection of what happened before.
                You're stuck at a standstill. Paralyzed with what if.
                What IF you condemned her by merely existing? God, you should have just tightened that tie just a little bit more so that <span class="angy">they</span> wouldn't even know who she was.
                You've concluded up to four options.
