            <p>
                "How about that resturant? The Nine of Dragons?" you text, you feel your palms get sweaty just waiting for her. It's really unhealthy <br>
                "sure! Sounds great" she replies. <br>
                "kk. meet at bus stop" you type faster than ever before<br>

                YES! you think to yourself. You  unplug your phone and put it on the side table. Only seven tallies on the note now, just one more day. That's when the end of this miserable storm of lonliness ends.
                why eight days? Because that's the amount of time until it's both of your birthdays. Each and every day will just be pleasant when you're used to going out with her. <br>
                Oh... you forgot her name a little bit. You go on the phone just to check. <br><br><br>

                <span class="forn surprise">f√≥rn</span> is her name <br><br><br>

                Such a pretty name. You get dressed and drive to the bus stop. A nice and ruby like shirt with a nice dress pants. You take some care to not be a failure for once.
                Your heart is fluttering as you see her waiting. Oh dear, she's so well dressed, the clothes just right in tightness to show just small parts of her svelte form while not being too obvious.
                You park the car and open the door for her. <br>
                "Hey Vas." she says so softly. <br>
                "hey" you respond. <br>
                She gets in the car and you drive. It's been how long now? You don't know. But it feels like eternity with her. Which is something you don't mind.
                You know, if your life was on a loop or recursive, you would be so happy. Meeting her for the first, second and every consecutive time after over and over.
                Maybe that's what heaven is like. Just repeating all the g- <br>
                "so how's it been?" she asks <br> 
                "Boring." you lie <br>
                "Ah, work's killin you huh?" she presses further as she reads your facial expressions like a book, "and don't lie to me"<br>
                "Boss is just being over the top ya know?" you say telling a omniscient lie. <br>
                "You can always call me if you're feeling down okay?" she hits your shoulder playfully, it brings you a slight smile<br>
                Soon you get to the resturant. The inside is bustling with other dates. None of which are nearly as happy or energetic as Forn.
                Both of you walk to the receptionist holding hands. Her palms are so smooth and soft like honey with a bit of jelly.
                The receptionist escorts you both to your seats. Both of you sit down in silence. Then more silence. This is a bit odd... Still silence.
                You look at her and she seems a bit off. Something here is wrong. You don't know what it is.
                What is wrong.
                What is wrong?
                What is wrong!?
