                She looks at you and says "okay" gosh this was so much more dissapointing than you thought.
                But just seeing her fills you with something you don't like.
                <span class="apathy">and it can never be there.</span>
                You compose yourself and remain calm.
                She makes friendly banter while you make one worded responses like a true machine.
                For some odd reason she says that she has to go and gets up to leave.
                There you see a man whom you know as Timotheos. He walks up to you.
                you exchange a few words and he gets up to find your beloved.
                But before he goes he asks. <br>
                "I expected you to be against this. Why are you so calm?"
