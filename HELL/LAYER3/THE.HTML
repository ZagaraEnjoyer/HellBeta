                "FINE" I say to myself in the mirror in patrid tones of malice and venom. It's really alot like commiting patricide. But instead of this being my dad.
                It's you. <br>
                yes.<br>
                You.<br>
                You.<br>
                I want to sacrifice YOU.<br>
                How many times did you kill me?<br>
                How many times did I kill her?<br>
                You're a sadistic prick<br>
                Seperating your identity away. All because of what? A little trouble handling guilt?!<br>
                Well you're in luck.<br>
                Hell needs a guilty person<br>
