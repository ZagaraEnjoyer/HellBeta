            <h1 class="poem">WAITING FOR ETERNITY IS LIKE WAITING FOR NOTHING</h1>
            <p>
                Your heart is still fluttering a bit. You decide to wait for the next bus. It takes a little while but soon the next one comes by as you get on. 
                You've never really liked your job as a criminal. Sometimes it's great! The adrenaline, the tension, the excitement and promises of riches are all just too enticing.
                But now you feel different about it. Like it's missing something. You take a look at your phone to read: <br>
                <span class="apathy">Kidnap the Holickers</span> <br>
                you audibly sigh as you press the stop button of the bus. You know every single stop that this bus goes through and keep track of everything about it. It's quite boring with no one to flex such useless talent on.
                Stepping out you find the house of the targets a bit down the road. You take a look around yourself to find that cane that you usually like to carry but it's not there. You must have forgotten it at home.
                Fists do just fine though, step by step you aproach. <br>
                knock knock knock. pause pause. knock pause knock pause knock. pause pause. knock knock knock.
                <br>
                The door creaks open to see an elderly man. You sigh once more, seems that God spares only babies, just not old ones.
                "Yes good sir?" he asks in a creaky cough ridden with age. <br>
                <span class="apathy">"Can thy enter your home? It's about that new matress of yours"</span> you say as per the usual. <br>
                "oh yes of course!" he opens the door producing a large creak. <br> <br>
                 You step inside and see that this mission won't be as ethically sound than you thought. Seems like he has visitors. 
                 A young woman catering a baby with the husband sitting on the couch drinking a flask of whiskey. The area smells a bit like cats as you see an elderly young lady sitting next to the woman, biding her time with knitting.
                 That's what? 2 weak targets and 2 strong ones? You're only one guy. Lets not forget that God decreed himself to Timotheos  <span class="angy poem">NO SOUL YOUNGER THAN THE CYCLE OF EARTHS ROTATION AROUND THE SUN SHALTH BE HARMED ON PURPOSE OR BY ACCIDENT. LEST YOU INCURR THE WRATH OF THE WASTELANDS BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL AND THAT OF MY ALTER SELF.</span> <br>
                 So it's more like 2 weak targets and 2 strong targets with the holiest shield amongst them all! <br>
                 You find yourself a spot to sit. You need to make your move soon before they start asking questions.
            </p>
