                Johnny you're drunk go home. I'll be over in a pinch. YOU'RE BEING IRRATIONAL! I THINK YOU'RE BEING A !@#$.
                SHE DON'T WANT ME! IT  ALL COMES CRASHING IN ONE- <br><br>
                HERE LIES CHARLIE, ARGHERM. YOU CAN TELL IT'S HIM BECAUSE WE PUT HIS NAME ON THE STONE. EXCUSE ME SIR! <br><br>
                No no no, none of these songs are good for this moment... Think me THINK!
                What should I sing about? <br> <br>
                At this rate I don't even mind the fact that there is a fire burning away at my flesh making me incapable of dancing now. <br>
                The smell is really making it hard to process what to do. I think my arm just fell off. I can't die like this! There's nothing stylish about this! OH PLEASE NO! AHHHHHHHHH!
