                I get into the car and drive to the front of my employer's company. Its stupid walls with stupid calls of stupid tall asks intimidate you. There's no one around.
                The dead silence is calming to me. It lets me think. I'm angry because I love her. I can't do this to her. I know that either way I'll suffer. I won't- NO, I CA-CAN'T.
                I won't let you take that away from me. I am done with YOUR choices. GO AHEAD, let me setup the altar.
