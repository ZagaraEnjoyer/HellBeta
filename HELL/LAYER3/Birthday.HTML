            <p>
                "You choose" you text her, you glance at the little note that you left yourself, incase both of you forgot. <br><br>
                there's eight tallies. Each one marks a special moment of your life with her. They also represent the days until it is both of yo- <br><br>
                "My place ;) it's a party in here" she responds. Your heart heaves against your chest as you feel like she might know what today is.<br><br>
                "omw" you put your phone down and get up with quick eagerness. You almost fell backwards on the way but it's all fine because you caught yourself on the way down.
                You get yourself dressed. You've never been genuinely invited to a party before, most of the time it was just for formality reasons or they didn't want it to be blatant that you were not liked at all. The parties back then were just. Lonely. <br> <br>
                But now this is different. This is the start of something new. Something happy! You have that slight gnawing feeling in your stomache though like something is eating at you alive.
                <br><br><br><br>
                Time flies! you're at her place, you don't know whether it was by bus or car or on foot but whatever it was, it got you pumped up! She lives in a beautiful house with nice amber paint. you anxiously take a few steps up and knock on the door.<br>
                she opens the door, <br>
                
                <span class="forn">"Hey, Vasanistírio! Come in!"</span> she says with much delight. loud music is heard from inside the house as it echoes off the walls. The area reeks of alcohol and quite possibly some drugs.<br><br>
                <span class="apathy">"Hey... thanks for the invite"</span> you say formally as you take a step in. <br><br>
                Now what should you do?
