            <h1>So much for committing crimes</h1>
            <p>
               You pull the fire alarm but as you turn back you see some weird purple eyes maniac with very offputting colours that reminds you of synthwave.
               He's hunched over like a maniac as he charges at you. He pins you against the wall and says <br>
               <span class="madness">"You have beautiful thighs"</span> <br>
               You reply formally and politely with the thruster into his gut. The weirdo staggers back letting you gain distance away from him. You see the weirdo pull out an orange remote trigger. <br>
               <span class="madness">"LIGHTY LIGHTER MC LIGHTERSON!"</span> he says to it, <span class="madness">"SET THE EXITS ON FIRE!"</span> and soon incendiary explosives detonate on the exits including the fire exits. This kills around twenty or so people. <br>
               So dissapointing. If you were the one doing it, you could have easily killed EVERYONE. <br>
               <span class="fancy">"Must you be so unprofessional?"</span> you say while executing the mad man with The Thruster before he could even think about going in for another kiss. <br>
               Now that threat is dead you have bigger problems on your mind. Like the fire that will be soon consuming you
