                OUCHIE! You wake up with a throbbing headache while your body feels like a rotting corpse with how ridgid it is. Where were you? You take a look around the room. <br>
                The room is a plain white like paper or papyrus. It's a pretty lame one though. A basic bedframe with a note on your bedside table that reads: <br>
                <br>
                "Your name is Vasanistírio. You refer to yourself in 2nd to 3rd person. Because if you started using those plain words like  (the phonetic) aɪ then you are sure to die. <br>
                Don't worry though, You won't die today. You can't! Just eight more days. Add a tally for every time you read this note. Just so you don't forget how many days are left <br>
                <br>
                - Vasanistírio, <br>aka you"
                <br><br>
                Alas it seems like there are, one. two. three. six... NINE? how could there be NINE tallies already? This makes no sense! Unless...
