                Now you remember! This is without a doubt the real one. You normally go here, learn your fate, and die of heart attack!
                You walk in, and ask the prophet about your fate. <br>
                "I see your death is near. There is not much you can do to avoid it" They say. Their eternal eyes glaring thousands of branches into your eyes. each one filled with pity. all of them ending just the same.
                You feel yourself get a heart attack from the panic that there is nothing that you can do to avoid it. Your memory dies from heart attack.
                Well if you're dead in your memory no matter what you do... Where the hell are you? <br>
                ...<br>
                ...<br>
                ...<br>
                ...<br>
                ...<br>
                OH !@#$<br>
                YOU'RE LATE FOR WORK! You run on out and sprint out of your apartment. You feel like that situation had arisen before.
                You're 100% sure that there was a timeline where you stubbed your toe on a chair and killed its sister but oh well!
                There ain't no time to waste!
                Now how in hell are you gonna get to your work building?
