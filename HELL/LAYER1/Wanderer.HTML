                You think long and hard about what this means. You decide to erase just one tally. Maybe instead of counting up you should count down. Maybe then will you be alive.
                The dread doesn't leave but that doesn't matter. You feel the creaking of the bed as you roll yourself out. <br>
                "can't die from having a neck snapped if one rolls out" you mutter to yourself. You do your delicate schedule of getting on clothes that you checked.
                First is the black undershirt, then the suit that makes space blush for how dark it is, then the tie that's only visible when a 40 lumen light shines on it, then some nice black pants that is darker than your shadow. Before you even put on your black socks to remind worms that blackholes exist, you look at the mirror. <br>
                "You look like you're dressed for a funeral" the reflection says to you at the same time you say it to you in the mirror.
