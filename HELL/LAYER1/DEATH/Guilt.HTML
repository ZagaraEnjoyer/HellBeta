                You tightens the tie on your neck. For You is the Justice Maker.
                You likes to punish those who are wrong.
                You likes to remember the time where was aÉª wrong.
                This black outfit is a reminder.
                YOUR reminder.
                That You cannot find peace after what You have done.
                You wanted to be innocent.
                So that You would be justified.
                But You can't run away.
