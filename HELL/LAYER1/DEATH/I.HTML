                I tightens the tie on my neck. For I is the eye that kills the self.
                I likes to feel the breath ease itself out of me.
                I likes to remember the things I have done, choke me.
                This Tie that I has is a reminder.
                I's reminder.
                That I cannot find peace after what I have done.
                I wanted to be you.
                So that I wouldn't kill I's self.
                But I can't run away.
