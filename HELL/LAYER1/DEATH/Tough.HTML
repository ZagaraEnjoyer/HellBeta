                You make a fast move and grab his gun and blast him. But you, being the moron you are, forgot that there were 2 other guards along with multiple others inside the building.
                You make a run for it and try to hide but then you get shanked by a thief heading to the bank but then the guards take you to the hospital.
                BUT ALAS! you get ran over by a car on the way there. By the time they get you to the hospital all the doctors turn you away saying that "he's a dead man". 
                You get sent home where you died of heart attack.
