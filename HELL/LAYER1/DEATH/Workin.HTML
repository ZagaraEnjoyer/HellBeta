                I take a busride to work like I usually do. Unfortunately due to I being pitch black. An officer guns I down.
                I ain't racist but that officer sure is. Maybe I should do something that doesn't make my cardiac arythmia worse.
                But it probably doesn't matter because something else gets me first. Afterall the heart is the safeguard.
