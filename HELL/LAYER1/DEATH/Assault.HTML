                You run to work, running as fast as you possibly can. But then you spot something. A woman being assaulted by a man!
                You step in and intervene. Pulling out a knife from your pocket and stab the man in the back.
                You stabbed yourself in the back.
                both of you feel the agonising pain.
                Both of you fall down to the ground.
