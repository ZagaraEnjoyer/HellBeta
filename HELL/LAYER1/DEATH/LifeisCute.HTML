                You give up. You ain't cute like you used to. Life was cute. So you make the connection. If Life is really out of your league here.
                Then why be alive? It's quite clear no one cares if you die because you can't really just walk up to them and say "If Vasanist√≠rio spontaneously ceases to exist would you feel sorry for me"
                And then they would give a half hearted response like "yo man you okay?" and thats just really awful. Nothin here is worth living for.
