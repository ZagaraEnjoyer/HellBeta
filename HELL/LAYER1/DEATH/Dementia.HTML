                I die of cardiac arrest whenever you think of I. Unless something else gets I first. Like swearing in purgatory or breaking the law.
                There is a punishment. I too forgot what I did to deserve this. But It definetly involved a poem. I wrote a poem yes. There's little fragments of each one.
                Maybe I can find them. Maybe I can't.
