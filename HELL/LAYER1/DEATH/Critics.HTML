                You hate everything about this. No matter how HARD you hide it you just see it seep through the small cracks of light.
                You see your face. You feel like you HAVE to smother it. To hide that little light. "YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS." you suffocate the reflection.
                And by proxy, You.
