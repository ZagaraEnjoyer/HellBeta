                "nope thats not right" you say as you erase the  tallies
                "you're here, that's enough reason to be afraid" you assure yourself
                you feel your heart beat harder and harder. <br>
                You see a life once lived across your face. <br>
                You remember. You're not supposed to be here. <br>
                your body paralizes as you remember the situation before this: <br>
                You're in a middle of a town, you are about to die. None of the buildings saved you.
                You went to the bank and got shot in a robbery, You got ran over on the way to the hospital, You died of cardiac arrest in your house. But you forgot what the 4th building was...
