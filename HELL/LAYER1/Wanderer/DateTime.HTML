                Yes you should go out to date. Take the pain off ya know? It's not easy living your life when death is round the corner.
                You get yourself dressed for romance. Some guys call it a bit "girly" but you don't think it's that bad. Afterall you got called cute wearing this once.
                Maybe you could try the old horse again. You get dressed in a nice crimson undershirt with a maroon suit on top. After some long thought you decide to wear an orange one. You fold your handkerchief to look like a heart as you tuck it into your right breast pocket.
                You feel like you've already googled "handkerchief code" so you probably don't want to reread that.
